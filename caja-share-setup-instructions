First, edit you /etc/samba/smb.conf, ie. by replacing all content by /etc/samba/nautilus-share-smb.conf.example. Remember to change "#YOUR WORKGROUP" to your real workgroup and "#YOUR GUEST ACCOUNT" to selected guest account (you can also disable it).

Then use few commands to make samba ready to support usershares (create directory, create special group, set owner(s) and permissions, add user(s) to the group).

Ensure Samba services (smb, nmb, winbind) are disabled.

$ export USERSHARES_DIR="/var/lib/samba/usershare"
$ export USERSHARES_GROUP="samba"

$ mkdir -p ${USERSHARES_DIR}
$ groupadd ${USERSHARES_GROUP}
$ chown root:${USERSHARES_GROUP} ${USERSHARES_DIR}
$ chmod 01770 ${USERSHARES_DIR}

$ usermod -a -G ${USERSHARES_GROUP} CHOOSED_USERNAME

Do not forget to reboot system (safest method to make Samba work, if runned at startup). Sometimes "/sbin/service NAME restart" for Samba services doesn't work well (wanted effect is not given).
